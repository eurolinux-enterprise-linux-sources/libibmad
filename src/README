libibmad is a convenience library to encode, decode, and dump IB MAD packets.  It
is implemented on top of and in conjunction with libibumad (the umad kernel
interface library.)

The main consumer of this library is the infiniband-diags package.

Dependencies:

	1) libibumad >= 1.3.7
	2) opensm-libs >= 3.3.10
	3) ib_umad kernel module

Release notes for 1.3.7 to 1.3.8 are:

   1) minor bug fixes
   2) Add SM/SA GUIDInfo support
   3) new smp_query_status_via functions
   4) Add new ib_rpc_v1_t with error field
   5) Add Extended Link Speed support as specified by published IBTA errata
   6) Support Additional Optional Performance Counters
   7) Support Mellanox vendor specific ExtendedPortInfo SM class MAD
   8) Add support for PortInfo CapabilityMask2


   These changes increment the soname to 7 but the library is backwards
   compatible to soname 5.
