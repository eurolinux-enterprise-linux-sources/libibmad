libibmad is a convenience library to encode, decode, and dump IB MAD packets.  It
is implemented on top of and in conjunction with libibumad (the umad kernel
interface library.)

The main consumer of this library is the infiniband-diags package.

Dependencies:

	1) libibumad >= 1.3.7
	2) opensm-libs >= 3.3.10
	3) ib_umad kernel module

Release notes for 1.3.8 to 1.3.9 are:

   1) bug fixes
   2) Add support for Congestion Control MAD's
   3) Add SA NodeRecord
   4) Add MKey support to ibmad_port object
   5) Update counter offsets for PortExtendedSpeedsCounters
   6) Additional print functions
        classportinfo dump function
	additional debugging

   These changes increment the soname to 8 but the library is backwards
   compatible to soname 5.
